Back at it. Today I'm adding a user login form, I think internally I'll use 'user' as copilot and everything else defaults to that. Flask-login will be how I'll handle login and permissions but I'll need to add a user registration form first.

Working through the login process, added the flask-login extension and updated the player model to include UserMixin. I've also added a user loader callback and created a login form using FlaskForm. I'm now working on the login and logout routes.

The flask-login procedure is still muddy for me, need to work through more.
